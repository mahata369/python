# File handling:file handling allows to manipulate file(create,write data to, read data from files)

'''
steps involved in file handling:
   open file
   perform operation(read/write)
   close file

   syntax:
   file -open("file_name","mode")

   
'''
# Modes
'''
write mode:
       create new files if not exists
       Deletes old contents if dile already exists

'''


# file -open("data.txt","w")
# file.write("Hello world...")
# file.close()

# '''
# read mode: r
#      read contents of file
#      file must exist
# '''
# file -open("data.txt","r")
# data = file.read()
# print(data)
# file.close()

# '''
# append mode: a
#      adds data at the end of file
#      doesn't overwrite old content
# '''
# file-open("data.txt","a")
# file.write("Hello everyone,this is file handling")
# file.close()


'''
read + write: r+
     file must exist
     can read and write
'''
# file = open("data.txt","r+")
# print(file.read())
# file.write("\nThis is new data")
# file.close()
'''
write + read: w+
      delete old data
      can read and write
'''
# file = open("data.txt","w+")
# file.write("Python file handling")
# file.seek(0)# seek helps to point the pointer from last
# print(file.read())
# file.close()
'''
append + read: a+
    create file if doesn't exist
    intially pointer is at the end of the file
'''
# file = open("data.txt","a+")
# file.write("\nNew data")
# file.seek(0)
# print(file.read())
# file.close()


# with open("data.txt","r") as file:
#     print(file.read())


# # From Gpt
# file = open("data.txt", "w")
# file.write("Hello world...")
# file.close()

# file = open("data.txt", "r")
# data = file.read()
# print(data)
# file.close()

# file = open("data.txt", "a")
# file.write("\nHello everyone, this is file handling")
# file.close()

# Saving user input
# name = input("Enter name:")
# age = input("Enter age:")

# with open("data.txt","a") as file:
#     #file.write("\nName:" + name + "\nAge:" + age)
#     file.write(f"\nName: {name} \nAge = {age}")
# print("Data saved sucessfully")

# Deleting the data entered by the user
import os

line_no = int(input("Enter line number to delete:"))

with open("data.txt","r") as original, open("temp.txt","w") as temp:
    for i, line in enumerate(original, start=1):
        if i != line_no:
            temp.write(line)

os.remove("data.txt")
os.rename("temp.txt","data.txt")

print("Line deleted sucessfully")
